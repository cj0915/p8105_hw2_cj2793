# Problem 1

## Read and clean the data:

First, we should read the excel file, select the columns of interest and
convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical
variable:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
cleaned_transit_df = read_csv(file = "hw2data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select("line", "station_name", "station_latitude", "station_longitude",
         c("route1":"route11"), "entry", "vending", "entrance_type", "ada") |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

transit_row = nrow(cleaned_transit_df)

transit_row
```

    ## [1] 1868

``` r
transit_col = ncol(cleaned_transit_df)

transit_col
```

    ## [1] 19

This data set contains information about entrances and exits for each
subway station in the NYC transit system. The key variables include the
subway line (`line`), station name (`station_name`), station location
(`station_latitude` combined with `station_longitude`), routes served
(`route1` ~ `route11`), whether entry is permitted (`entry`), vending
machine availability (`vending`), entrance type (`entrance_type`), and
ADA compliance (`ada`). In the cleaning process, we selected these
relevant columns from the original data set and converted the `entry`
variable from a character format (YES/NO) to a logical format
(TRUE/FALSE). The resulting data set contains 19 columns and retains all
1868 original rows from the source data. These data are not “tidy”:
route number should be a variable, as should route.

## Answer the following questions using these data:

1.  How many distinct stations are there?

Here, We first create a new variable called ‘Station’, which is the full
name of the Station, like ‘125th St 8th Avenue’ and then do the
analysis.

``` r
cleaned_transit_df <- cleaned_transit_df |>
  mutate(Station = paste(station_name, line, sep = " "))

num_distinct_stations <- cleaned_transit_df |>
  distinct(Station) |>
  nrow()

num_distinct_stations
```

    ## [1] 465

There are 465 stations.

2.  How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ada_status <- cleaned_transit_df |>
  filter(ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(Station) |>
  nrow()

ada_status
```

    ## [1] 84

There are 84 stations with ADA compliant.

3.  What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance?

``` r
wihout_vending <- cleaned_transit_df |>
  filter(vending == "NO")

entry_status <- wihout_vending |>
  filter(entry == TRUE) |>
  distinct(Station) |>
  nrow()

vending_status <- wihout_vending |> 
  distinct(Station) |>
  nrow()

proportion <- entry_status / vending_status

proportion
```

    ## [1] 0.4343434

Proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance
is 0.4343434.

## Reformat data and answer some questions about A train:

``` r
cleaned_transit_df <- cleaned_transit_df |>
  mutate(across(starts_with("route"), as.character))

long_data <- cleaned_transit_df |>
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, 
               names_to = "route_number", 
               values_to = "route_name") |>
  filter(!is.na(route_name))

# How many distinct stations serve the A train?
A_train_stations <- long_data |>
  filter(route_name == "A") |>
  distinct(Station) |>
  nrow()

A_train_stations
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
# Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?
ada_status_A <- long_data |>
  filter(route_name == "A", ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(Station) |>
  nrow()

ada_status_A
```

    ## [1] 17

60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that serve the A
train, 17 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 2

## Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
file_path <- "hw2data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx"
Mr_trashwheel_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

Mr_trashwheel_data <- Mr_trashwheel_data[, -c(15, 16)] |>
  # omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) |>
  # round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an    integer variable
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) |>
  # add an additional variable to keep track of Trash Wheel
  mutate(Trash_Wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

## Read and clean the Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
# specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
file_path <- "hw2data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx"
Prof_trashwheel_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

Prof_trashwheel_data <- Prof_trashwheel_data |>
  # omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) |>
  # add an additional variable to keep track of Trash Wheel
  mutate(Trash_Wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel")
```

## Read and clean the Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
# specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
file_path <- "hw2data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx"
Gwy_trashwheel_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

Gwy_trashwheel_data <- Gwy_trashwheel_data |>
  # omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) |>
  # add an additional variable to keep track of Trash Wheel
  mutate(Trash_Wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
```

## Combine all datasets into a single tidy dataset:

``` r
combined_data <- bind_rows(Mr_trashwheel_data, Prof_trashwheel_data, Gwy_trashwheel_data)
```

## Write a paragraph about these data:

``` r
# Count the number of observations in the data set (with duplication)
num_observations <- nrow(combined_data)

num_observations
```

    ## [1] 1033

``` r
# Total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
Prof_trashwheel_weight <- combined_data |>
  filter(Trash_Wheel == "Professor Trash Wheel") |>
  summarize(Total_Weight = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pull(Total_Weight)

Prof_trashwheel_weight
```

    ## [1] 246.74

``` r
# Total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022
Gwy_cigbutts_number <- combined_data |>
  filter(Trash_Wheel == "Gwynnda Trash Wheel" &
         month == "June" & 
         year == 2022) |>
  summarize(Total_Number = sum(cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pull(Total_Number)

Gwy_cigbutts_number
```

    ## [1] 18120

The data set contains a total of 1033 observations across three trash
wheels: Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel.
Each observation represents a record of the amount of trash collected
for various categories, such as `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`,
`cigarette_butts`, `glass_bottles`, and `sports_balls`. One key variable
in the data set is `weight_tons`, which records the weight of trash
collected in tons. For the available data, Professor Trash Wheel
collected a total of 246.74 tons of trash. Additionally, Gwynnda Trash
Wheel collected 1.812^{4} cigarette butts in June of 2022.

# Problem 3

## Import, clean, tidy, and otherwise wrangle bakers, bakes and results datasets:

First, we should import the three data sets:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
bakers_df = read_csv(file = "hw2data/bakers.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

# For bakes_df, we get some potential NA value:
bakes_df = read.csv(file = "hw2data/bakes.csv", na = c("", "N/A", "UNKNOWN", "Unknown")) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

results_df = read.csv(file = "hw2data/results.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  slice(3:n()) |> # We only keep the data from the third row
  setNames(c("series", "episode", "baker", "technical", "result")) # Rename the columns
```

Now, all three data sets are tidy. We should then check for completeness
and correctness across data sets.

## Check for completeness and correctness across datasets:

In the first place, we should check the consistency of data types as
usual. Here, we find that the `series` and `episode` variables in
`bakes_df`, `results_df` and `bakers_df` have different data formats, as
a result, we should keep them consistent (I convert them to numeric type
here).

``` r
str(bakers_df)
```

    ##  $ technical: chr  "2" "3" "1" NA ...
    ##  $ result   : chr  "IN" "IN" "IN" "IN" ...

We also notice that in `bakers_df`, `bakers` have full name recorded.
However, in `bakes_df` and `results_df`, `bakers` only have first name
recorded. We should make bakers’ names consistent:

``` r
bakers_df <- bakers_df |>
  mutate(baker = word(baker, 1))
```

Now, we have ensured the consistency of data sets. Then, let’s use
`anti_join` to check the completeness and correctness across data sets.

1.  Let’s check how many records from the `bakes_df` do not have a
    matching `series` and `baker` in the `bakers_df` and vice versa.

``` r
anti_join(bakes_df, bakers_df, by = c("series", "baker"))
```

``` r
rb_number <- anti_join(results_df, bakes_df, by = c("series", "episode", "baker")) |>
  nrow()
```

Here we can see that `"Jo"` records from the `bakes_df` do not have a
matching `series`, `episode`, and `baker` in the `results_df`; 596
records from the `results_df` that do not have a matching `series`,
`episode`, and `baker` in the `bakes_df`.

3.  Last but not least, we should also check how many records from the
    `bakers_df` do not have a matching `series`and `baker` in the
    `results_df` and vice versa.

``` r
anti_join(bakers_df, results_df, by = c("series", "baker"))
```

Here we can see that `Jo` records from the `bakers_df` do not have a
matching `series` and `baker` in the `results_df`; `Joanne` record from
the `results_df` do not have a matching `series` and `baker` in the
`bakers_df`.

According to `anti_join`, we notice that in `bakes_df`, `"Jo"` should be
`Jo`, without quotation marks. Let’s change it:

``` r
bakes_df[,"baker"] <- gsub('"', '', bakes_df[,"baker"])
```

Then, We should check how many records from the `bakes_results` do not
have a matching `series`, `episode`, and `baker` in the `results_df`
again after fix the quotation mark problem.

``` r
anti_join(bakes_df, results_df, by = c("series", "episode", "baker"))
```

Here we can see that `Jo` records from the `bakes_df` still do not have
a matching `series`, `episode`, and `baker` in the `results_df`, which
means that in `results_df`, there is not a candidate called `Jo`.
However, `Jo` in `bakes_df` and `bakers_df`is in series 2. In addition,
we notice that in `results_df`, we have a candidate called `Joanne` in
series 2 who also does not appear in `bakers_df`. As a result, we
consider `Jo` as `Joanne`. As a result, we consider to change `Joanne`
to `Jo` in `results_df`.

``` r
results_df[, 3] <- gsub("Joanne", "Jo", results_df[, 3])
```

Also, we notice that `Diana` withdraw from the competition at episode 5
in series 5 (with WD result). As a result, we consider the results of
`Diana` after episode 5 in series 5 as `NA`:

``` r
results_df <- results_df |>
  mutate(result = if_else(baker == "Diana" & episode > 5, NA, result)) |>
  drop_na(result)
```

Now, let’s use `anti_join` to check the completeness and correctness
across data sets again after the modification.

``` r
check_again1 <- anti_join(bakes_df, bakers_df, by = c("series", "baker")) |>
  nrow()

check_again2 <- anti_join(bakes_df, results_df, by = c("series", "episode", "baker")) |>
  nrow()

check_again3 <- anti_join(bakers_df, results_df, by = c("series", "baker")) |>
  nrow()

check_again1
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
check_again2
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
check_again3
```

    ## [1] 0

From the results of checking, we can see that all observations in
`bakes_df` show up in `bakers_df` and `results_df`; all obs in
`bakers_df` show up in `results_df`. As a result, we can now join these
data sets.

## Merge and organize a single, final dataset

``` r
bakes_results <- results_df |>
  left_join(bakes_df, by = c("series", "episode", "baker"))

final_data <- bakes_results |>
  left_join(bakers_df, by = c("series", "baker")) |>
  select(series, episode, baker, baker_age, baker_occupation, hometown, 
         signature_bake, show_stopper, technical, result) |>
  arrange(series, episode, baker)
```

## Export the final data set

``` r
write_csv(final_data, "hw2data/final_bakeoff_data.csv")
```

## Describe the data cleaning process and briefly discuss the final dataset

The data cleaning process involved importing and standardizing three
data sets—`bakers`, `bakes`, and `results`—by cleaning column names and
ensuring consistent data types, particularly for `series` and `episode`.
A key challenge was unifying baker names, as `bakers_df` used full names
while other data sets used first names, so we opted to use only first
names for consistency. Another important choice was handling misleading
data, such as replacing `"Jo"` with `Jo` in `bakes_df`; replacing
`Joanne` with `Jo` in `results_df`; and adjusting results for `Diana`,
who withdrew mid-competition. After ensuring completeness across data
sets, they were merged into a final data set.

Once the data sets were merged, the columns were reorganized for better
readability. The `baker_age`, `baker_occupation` and `hometown` columns
were moved immediately after the `baker` column. To further enhance the
structure of the data set, the data was sorted by series, episode, and
baker, ensuring a logical flow that made it easy to track each progress
of each series.

Finally, the cleaned and organized data set was exported as
`final_bakeoff_data.csv`. The resulting data set includes detailed
demographic information about each baker, such as their first name, age,
occupation, and hometown, along with performance data for each episode
in each series, including signature and showstopper bakes, technical
rankings, and overall episode results. The logical structure of the data
set allows for easy tracking of individual contestants and their
journeys across seasons.

## Create a reader-friendly table

``` r
starbakers_winners <- final_data |>
  filter(series %in% c("5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10") & 
         result %in% c("STAR BAKER", "WINNER")) |>
  select(series, episode, baker, baker_age, baker_occupation, hometown, technical, result) |>
  arrange(series, episode, baker)

winners <- starbakers_winners |>
  filter(result == "WINNER")
```

From the results, we can conclude that most of the winners appear to be
in their 30s, except for Nancy, who won Season 5 at the age of 60. Also,
we notice that all winners have high ranks of technical skills (ranking
at first or second place). To our surprise, the competition is highly
dynamic and the overall winner (like David in series 10) could never get
star baker throughout the season.

## Import, clean, tidy, and organize the viewership data

``` r
viewers_df = read.csv(file = "hw2data/viewers.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()
head(viewers_df, 10)
```

What was the average viewership in Season 1? In Season 5?

``` r
Series1 = viewers_df |>
  pull(series_1)
S1_mean = mean(Series1, na.rm = TRUE)

Series5 = viewers_df |>
  pull(series_5)
S5_mean = mean(Series5, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The average viewership in Season 1 was 2.77, in Season 5 was 10.0393.
